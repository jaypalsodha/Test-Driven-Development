# Test Driven Development

- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: 

- Requirements are turned into very specific test cases(in java we can consider small specific method), then the software is improved so that the tests pass. 

- This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.

- Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concept
