# Test Driven Development

- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: 

- Requirements are turned into very specific test cases(in java we can consider small specific method), then the software is improved so that the tests pass. 

- This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.

- Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concept

# Test-driven development cycle
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails
3. Write the code
4. Run tests
5. Refactor code

Once done, repeat the same thing again. . . .
# 1.  Add a Test
- In test-driven development, each new feature begins with writing a test. 
- Write a test that defines a function or improvements of a function, which should be very succinct. 
- To write a test, the developer must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements. 
- The developer can accomplish this through use cases and user stories to cover the requirements and exception conditions, and can write     the test in whatever testing framework is appropriate to the software environment. 
- It could be a modified version of an existing test. 
- This is a differentiating feature of test-driven development versus writing unit tests after the code is written: it makes the developer   focus on the requirements before writing the code, a subtle but important difference.
